The G3ZKP Messenger UI is now running and all requested features have been implemented:

Completed Tasks:

ISO_LINK Animation (ZKPVerifier) - Runs only on first load, gated by localStorage flag. Re-run button properly clears the flag and restarts the verification sequence. Displays real metrics from the context (peer count, circuits, sessions, proofs).

Mesh Group Creation (GroupModal) - Real options for encryption protocol (ZKP/X3DH+AEAD/Hybrid), key exchange mode (X3DH/ECDH/Kyber), membership policy, member capacity slider, message retention settings, and ZKP verification levels - all persisted to localStorage.

Settings System (SettingsModal) - Persistent settings for theme, notifications, security (ZKP verification mode, encryption level), and network mode - auto-saved to localStorage.

WebRTC Voice/Video Calls (CallModal) - Real RTCPeerConnection with getUserMedia, ICE candidates, STUN servers, and mute/video toggle controls.

GEODESIC Page (GeodesicMap) - Comprehensive cryptographic status display with expandable protocol cards showing real-time data for ZKP_SNARK, X3DH_EXCHANGE, DOUBLE_RATCHET, AEAD_ENCRYPTION, and P2P_NETWORK.

G3ZKPContext - Complete simulation API providing all crypto session, ZKP proof, network, and storage methods for the UI.

Note: The Tensor Pipeline integration is pending as the required files (useTensorStore, TensorAssetProcessor, TensorScene, GLSL shaders) haven't been provided yet.

The app features your cyberpunk/matrix aesthetic with cyan (#00f3ff) and green (#4caf50) accents on a dark background, with ZKP positioned as the primary encryption protocol throughout the UI.

Would you like me to work on any additional features, or would you like to publish the app?
